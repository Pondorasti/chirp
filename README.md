## Notes

According to Twitter's [Brand Toolkit](https://about.twitter.com/en/who-we-are/brand-toolkit), an embedded Tweet should use `Helvetica Neue`. However, [Figma Widgets](https://www.figma.com/widget-docs/api/component-Text#fontfamily) do not support using custom fonts and are limited to font families from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/about). Therefore, `Inter` has been picked as a middle-ground.
